## Notes on Traditional Frequencies

These frequency associations are modern interpretations and should not be considered historically authentic to the original traditions. They represent contemporary practitioners' attempts to connect ancient wisdom with frequency-based practice.

Most traditional cultures did not conceive of their practices in terms of Hz frequencies—this is a modern overlay that may or may not resonate with the original spiritual intent.
