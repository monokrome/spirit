## Cultural Context

### Respect and Appropriation
These traditions are living religions with initiated priesthoods:
- **Yoruba/Ifá**: Babalawo and Iyanifa (diviners), various Orisha priests
- **Santería**: Santeros/Santeras, Babalawo
- **Vodou**: Hougan (priest), Mambo (priestess)

The frequencies here are for educational purposes and general meditation. They should not be considered substitutes for:
- Proper initiation
- Study with authentic practitioners
- Respectful engagement with the tradition

### Historical Background

**Yoruba Religion**
- Originated in Yorubaland (Nigeria/Benin)
- Rich cosmology of 401+ Orishas
- Sophisticated divination system (Ifá)
- Survived Middle Passage through syncretism

**Haitian Vodou**
- Developed during colonial slavery in Saint-Domingue
- Synthesis of Fon, Kongo, and Taino elements
- Catholic imagery adopted for survival
- Central to Haitian Revolution (1791-1804)

## The Role of Music and Rhythm

In both traditions, music is essential to practice:

### Yoruba/Santería
- **Batá drums**: Sacred three-drum ensemble
- **Specific rhythms**: Each Orisha has particular rhythmic patterns (toques)
- **Songs**: Oriki (praise poems) and other devotional music
- **Dance**: Each Orisha has characteristic movements

### Haitian Vodou
- **Drums**: Rada and Petwo drum batteries
- **Rhythms**: Specific to each Lwa (nago, yanvalou, etc.)
- **Songs**: Call and response in Haitian Kreyòl
- **Dance**: Invites Lwa presence ("mounting")

The frequencies in Spirit are single-tone generators and cannot replicate the complex polyrhythmic traditions essential to these practices.

## Ethical Guidelines

When engaging with these traditions:

1. **Respect**: These are not "exotic curiosities" but living religions
2. **Learn**: Read works by practitioners and scholars from the traditions
3. **Don't claim**: Using frequencies doesn't make one an initiate
4. **Support**: If drawn to these traditions, seek out legitimate communities
5. **Avoid**: Commercial exploitation, Halloween costumes, horror movie stereotypes
