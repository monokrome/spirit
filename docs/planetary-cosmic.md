| 141.27 Hz | Mercury | Orbital period (87.97 days) |
| 221.23 Hz | Venus | Orbital period (224.7 days) |
| 194.18 Hz | Earth (Year) | Orbital period (365.25 days) |
| 126.22 Hz | Sun | Earth's orbit around Sun |
| 144.72 Hz | Mars | Orbital period (686.98 days) |
| 183.58 Hz | Jupiter | Orbital period (4,332.59 days) |
| 147.85 Hz | Saturn | Orbital period (10,759.22 days) |
| 207.36 Hz | Uranus | Orbital period (30,688.5 days) |
| 211.44 Hz | Neptune | Orbital period (60,182 days) |
| 140.25 Hz | Pluto | Orbital period (90,560 days) |
| 210.42 Hz | Moon (Synodic) | Lunar month (29.53 days) |
| 227.43 Hz | Moon (Sidereal) | Sidereal period (27.32 days) |

| Frequency | Sign | Element | Ruling Planet |
|-----------|------|---------|---------------|
| 256.87 Hz | Aries | Fire | Mars |
| 280.50 Hz | Taurus | Earth | Venus |
| 288.33 Hz | Gemini | Air | Mercury |
| 296.07 Hz | Cancer | Water | Moon |
| 304.44 Hz | Leo | Fire | Sun |
| 312.46 Hz | Virgo | Earth | Mercury |
| 321.88 Hz | Libra | Air | Venus |
| 330.66 Hz | Scorpio | Water | Mars/Pluto |
| 340.08 Hz | Sagittarius | Fire | Jupiter |
| 350.02 Hz | Capricorn | Earth | Saturn |
| 360.00 Hz | Aquarius | Air | Saturn/Uranus |
| 370.88 Hz | Pisces | Water | Jupiter/Neptune |

**Source**: Various astrological and esoteric traditions. Different systems use different frequencies; these represent one common approach based on sequential tuning.

## Moon Phase Frequencies

Frequencies associated with lunar phases and their energetic qualities.

| Frequency | Phase | Association |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 210.42 Hz | New Moon | New beginnings, intention setting |
| 215.00 Hz | Waxing Crescent | Growth, building momentum |
| 220.00 Hz | First Quarter | Action, challenges, decision |
| 225.00 Hz | Waxing Gibbous | Refinement, adjustment |
| 230.00 Hz | Full Moon | Culmination, manifestation, illumination |
| 225.00 Hz | Waning Gibbous | Gratitude, sharing, teaching |
| 220.00 Hz | Last Quarter | Release, forgiveness, letting go |
| 215.00 Hz | Waning Crescent | Surrender, rest, preparation |

**Source**: Lunar phase associations from various folklore and magical traditions. Base frequency (210.42 Hz) from Cousto's synodic moon calculation. Phase frequencies are modern additions based on energetic associations.

## The Cosmic Octave Method

Hans Cousto's approach converts any periodic phenomenon into audible frequency:

1. Calculate the period (time for one complete cycle)
2. Take the reciprocal to get frequency (very low, inaudible)
3. Double the frequency repeatedly (octave transposition)
4. Continue until reaching audible range (20-20,000 Hz)

This maintains the mathematical relationship while making the "cosmic frequency" audible. Whether this creates meaningful resonance is philosophically debated.
