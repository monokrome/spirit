## Energy System Theory

### Subtle Energy Concept
These systems share the concept of subtle energy (prana, chi, ki) flowing through the body in organized patterns. While not validated by mainstream science, they form the foundation of practices like acupuncture, yoga, and energy healing.

### Cross-Cultural Parallels
- **Hindu/Yogic**: Chakras, nadis, prana
- **Chinese**: Meridians, dan tian, chi
- **Japanese**: Hara, ki
- **Western esoteric**: Aura, etheric body

### Scientific Status
While some studies show measurable effects from practices based on these systems (e.g., acupuncture research), the existence of subtle energy as described remains unproven. The frequencies in this category are based on traditional associations and practitioner experience rather than scientific measurement.
