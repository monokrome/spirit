## Solfeggio Frequencies

A set of frequencies derived from medieval hymns, widely used in sound healing practices.

| Frequency | Name | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| 174 Hz | Foundation | Grounding, relaxation |
| 285 Hz | Quantum Cognition | Wellness, safety |
| 396 Hz | Ut | Liberating guilt and fear |
| 417 Hz | Re | Facilitating change |
| 528 Hz | Mi | Love, transformation, harmony |
| 639 Hz | Fa | Connecting relationships |
| 741 Hz | Sol | Awakening intuition, expression |
| 852 Hz | La | Returning to spiritual order |
| 963 Hz | Si | Divine consciousness, enlightenment |

**Source**: Originally derived from "Ut queant laxis," an 8th-century Gregorian chant. Modern claims popularized by Dr. Joseph Puleo and Dr. Leonard Horowitz in *Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse* (1999). The claimed ancient origins are disputed by musicologists.

## Tibetan Singing Bowl Frequencies

Traditional Himalayan singing bowls produce complex tones with fundamental frequencies and overtones.

| Frequency | Name | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| 110 Hz | Root Bowl | Grounding, base frequency |
| 136.1 Hz | OM Bowl | Traditional OM tuning |
| 172 Hz | Sacral Bowl | Creativity, emotions |
| 194.18 Hz | Earth Day | Earth year frequency |
| 210.42 Hz | Moon | Synodic moon frequency |
| 221.23 Hz | Venus | Venus orbital frequency |
| 256 Hz | Scientific C | Pure C note |
| 288 Hz | D Bowl | Sacral/solar plexus |
| 324 Hz | E Bowl | Solar plexus |
| 341.3 Hz | F Bowl | Heart |

**Source**: Acoustical studies of traditional Himalayan bowls. Planetary frequencies calculated by Hans Cousto in *The Cosmic Octave* (1978), deriving audio frequencies from astronomical orbital periods.

## Special Frequencies

Notable frequencies from various research and traditions.

| Frequency | Name | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| 432 Hz | Concert A | Natural tuning (Verdi pitch) |
| 440 Hz | Standard A | Modern concert pitch |
| 528 Hz | Love Frequency | Harmony and transformation |
| 7.83 Hz | Schumann | Earth resonance fundamental |

**Source**: 440 Hz standardized in 1955 by ISO. 432 Hz advocacy based on claimed mathematical relationships to nature. Schumann resonance discovered through electromagnetic research.

## Historical Context

### Solfeggio Origins
The original solfeggio scale (Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La) comes from Guido of Arezzo's 11th-century music theory, using syllables from the hymn "Ut queant laxis." The modern "extended solfeggio" frequencies (174, 285, 963 Hz, etc.) were added in the late 20th century through numerological calculations.

### 432 Hz vs 440 Hz Debate
Proponents claim 432 Hz is more "natural" and mathematically harmonious. Critics note that pitch standards have varied throughout history (baroque pitch was often around 415 Hz), and there's no scientific evidence for claimed health benefits. The debate continues in both music and sound healing communities.

### Singing Bowl Tradition
Himalayan singing bowls have been used in Tibetan Buddhist practice for centuries. The bowls produce a fundamental frequency plus inharmonic overtones that create their characteristic sound. Modern "crystal singing bowls" are tuned to specific frequencies for chakra work.

## Technical Notes

Spirit generates singing bowl sounds using:
- Fundamental frequency
- Inharmonic overtones at non-integer ratios (typical of metal bowls)
- Exponential amplitude decay (simulating the bowl's sustain)
- Beat frequencies between close overtones (creating the "wobble" effect)
