## Rife Frequencies

Royal Raymond Rife (1888-1971) claimed to destroy pathogens with specific frequencies.

| Frequency | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 20 Hz | General Wellness | Baseline frequency |
| 727 Hz | General Pathogen | Most commonly cited |
| 787 Hz | Bacteria General | Broad spectrum claim |
| 880 Hz | Bacteria/Virus | Multi-purpose |
| 5000 Hz | Tissue Regeneration | Cellular repair |
| 10000 Hz | Nerve Regeneration | Neural tissue |
| 304 Hz | Adrenal Support | Endocrine system |
| 528 Hz | DNA Repair | Also appears in Solfeggio |

**Source**: Rife's original research (1930s) remains controversial. Modern "Rife machines" are not FDA-approved medical devices. Practitioners today use various frequency lists compiled from Rife's notes and later experimentation.

**Scientific Status**: Rife's claims have not been validated by peer-reviewed research. The AMA and mainstream medicine do not recognize Rife therapy. Users should not substitute these frequencies for medical treatment.

**Source**: Chromotherapy traditions combined with chakra color correspondences. Audio-to-color mapping is symbolic rather than physical.

## Scientific Considerations

### Evidence Status
Most healing frequency claims lack peer-reviewed scientific support:
- **Rife**: Historical claims, no modern validation
- **Crystal healing**: Considered pseudoscience by mainstream medicine
- **Organ resonance**: No anatomical basis for specific frequencies
- **DNA activation**: Not supported by molecular biology

### Potential Mechanisms
What might explain reported benefits:
1. **Relaxation response**: Sound therapy can induce relaxation
2. **Placebo effect**: Belief in treatment activates healing responses
3. **Meditation enhancement**: Frequencies may aid focus
4. **Binaural beat effects**: Some measurable EEG changes

### Safe Exploration
- Do not replace medical treatment with frequencies
- Use as complement to professional healthcare
- Report serious symptoms to qualified practitioners
- Maintain critical thinking while exploring
