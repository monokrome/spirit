# Brainwave Entrainment

Brainwave entrainment uses rhythmic audio stimuli to synchronize brainwave frequencies with specific states of consciousness.

## Commands

- `brainwaves` - Core brainwave states
- `consciousness` - Altered consciousness states
- `monroe` - Monroe Institute Focus Levels
- `sleep` - Sleep and dream frequencies
- `cognitive` - Cognitive enhancement

## Brainwave States

The brain produces electrical patterns at different frequencies corresponding to various mental states.

| State | Frequency Range | Associated State |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| Delta | 0.5-4 Hz | Deep sleep, healing, unconscious |
| Theta | 4-8 Hz | Deep meditation, REM sleep, creativity |
| Alpha | 8-12 Hz | Relaxed awareness, light meditation |
| Beta | 12-30 Hz | Active thinking, focus, alertness |
| Gamma | 30-100 Hz | Peak awareness, insight, higher cognition |

## How Brainwave Entrainment Works

The brain naturally tends to synchronize with rhythmic external stimuli through a process called "frequency following response" (FFR). When exposed to consistent rhythmic audio:

1. **Binaural beats**: Two slightly different frequencies played in each ear create a perceived "beat" at the difference frequency
2. **Isochronic tones**: Evenly spaced sound pulses that create rhythmic stimulation
3. **Monaural beats**: Pre-mixed beat frequencies that work through speakers

### Technical Notes

- Frequencies below 20 Hz are generated as **binaural beats** (requires headphones)
- A 100 Hz carrier frequency is used for sub-audible target frequencies
- Higher frequencies are generated as pure sine waves

### Scientific Status

While brainwave entrainment shows measurable effects on EEG patterns, claims about specific benefits remain under investigation. Peer-reviewed research exists but conclusions vary. This tool is for experimentation, not medical treatment.
